# Sweet Treats Management System

Welcome to coding project to build a **Sweet Treats and Cookies Store Website**! üç™üéâ

## Project Overview

This project is designed to provide a simple and efficient solution for individuals who manage small stores or social media pages that sell sweets and cookies. Built using **React** for the frontend and **Laravel** for the backend, this system will help users streamline their business operations. ‚ú®Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è

## Features

The website provides the following features to help small business owners:

1. **Order Management**: Keep track of all customer orders easily and efficiently.
2. **Customer Information**: Store and manage customer details, including contact information.
3. **Inventory Management**: Monitor your current stock and keep track of what products are in production.

## How to Start Working on the Project

To get started with the project, you need to install and set up both **Laravel** and **React**. Below are the instructions for each:

### Laravel Setup

1. **Install Composer**: Laravel uses Composer to manage its dependencies. You can install Composer by following the instructions [here](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sweet-treats-management.git
   cd sweet-treats-management/backend
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. **Set up the environment**:
   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. **Generate an application key**:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

6. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

7. **Start the Laravel development server**:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

### React Setup

1. **Install Node.js**: React requires Node.js to run. You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the React development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Now, the Laravel backend will be running on `http://localhost:8000`, and the React frontend on `http://localhost:3000`.
